 k1 -> v1
 k2 -> v2
 
 
 now you're trying to add k1 -> v3 | not possible k1 already there
 
 Insert,
 Search,  all opr. are in O(1) 
 Delete
 
 all stored in random order
 
 because it uses internal hashing to create diff. o/p | collisions also happen inside hash
 
 h(263483) = mapped to 7 
 h("vishal") = mapped to 5
 h({name="any"}) = mapped to 3 like these | for java it always uses INTEGER for mapping
 
 
 for large keys = key%m
 string = weighted sum 
 objects = weighted sum of elements
